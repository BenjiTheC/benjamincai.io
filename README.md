My personal site built in React with 100% function components and hooks.

Currently working on redesign the website for 2021.

## Some notes on re-building website

How should I store the static data for projects/resume in the repo? JSON or JS module? What should be the format of it?

Should I use an existed CSS/SASS framework instead of writing my own?

Should I use an existed component library?
